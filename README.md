## Work Experience
**Senior Planning Specialist @ DP World, JABAL ALI FZE, DUBAI, UAE (_Novenember 2024 - Present_)**
-collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify synergies and implement impactful improvements. My work involves developing cutting-edge algorithms for data-intensive problems and scaling solutions for logistics and scheduling challenges in ports. I am contributing to innovation at DP World by addressing complex business and engineering
challenges.

**Data Science Operations Research, Reliance Jio Platform, Navi Mumbai, India (_August 2022 - Octomber 2024_)**
I have contributed to solve some real world business projects within retail and CPG domain using state-of-the-art machine leanring and operations research models

## Projects

• **Assortment Planning**: I developed an assortment planning tool for CPG B2B business that facilitates decisionmaking on product selection based on factors such as market demand, customer transactions, and product coverage. The strategy has helped the business team to achieve a profit of around 10-15% for every business cycle.

• **Rail Rakes Scheduling**: Developed MILP tool for railway rakes allocation, optimizing utilization, and meeting
capacity constraints for distribution of Petrochemical products. The model optimizes rakes, shipment strategy, and
allocation based on demand. Collaborated with back-end and petrochemical teams to create a user interface. We
patented the algorithm and presented the research at the ORSI conference at IISC Bangalore, 2023.

• **Vehicle Routing**: I implemented Google Maps API for route optimization, fetching real-time coordinates for over
1000 locations. Improved clustering strategy by 13%, reducing end-to-end transportation by 10-15% compared to
existing algorithms. I implemented algorithms such as Google OR tools, Integer programming, and Hybrid Genetic
Algorithm.

• **Reliance DS platform**: I have developed multiple APIs for projects such as network optimization, transportation,
inventory management, shipment optimization, and terminal-ro mapping.
